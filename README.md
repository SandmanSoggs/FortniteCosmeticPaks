If you would like to use a mod, add the .pak file to your Paks Folder (Version > FortniteGame > Content > Paks), add a .sig from the appropriate season in the Sigs folder to your Paks folder which is located in the Sigs folder, copy the .pak name, re-name the .sig to the .pak and it should work.

(I will upload a tutorial soon)
